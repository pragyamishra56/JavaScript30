feat: Add dynamic text shadow effect based on mouse movement

- Implemented a mousemove event listener on the '.hero' element to track cursor position.
- Calculated shadow offset dynamically using the element's dimensions and mouse coordinates.
- Added colorful multi-directional shadows for a visually appealing effect.
- Ensured smooth shadow movement by normalizing the cursor's position within the element.

This enhances the interactivity of the webpage and improves user engagement.
